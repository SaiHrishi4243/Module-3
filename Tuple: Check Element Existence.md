# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## ðŸ§¾ Program

```python

x=("tuple",8,"test","n","not",78,11)
if "n" in x:
    print("string 'n' exists within the tuple.")
if 8 in x:
    print("integer 8 exists within the tuple.")

```

## Output

## Result

Thus implemented the python program to check if the element "n" and the element '8' exist within a given tuple.
